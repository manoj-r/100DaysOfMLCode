# 100DaysOfMLCode

## Day 1

Progress: 
Enrolled in course by Andrew Ng. Started Week 1. Installed jupyter. 
Introduction about broad variety of algorithms(Supervised/Unsupervised)
Regression, Classification. 

Thoughts:
Have been thinking about doing this challenge for a long time. Hope I can complete this challenge. Objectives by the end of challenge: NLP, Computer vision


## Day 2

Progress:
Continued on course by Andre Ng. 
Basics of unsupervised learning.
Understanding of different algorithms, 
Clustering, Non-clustering(Cocktail party algorithm)
Supervised Learning - Regression:
Univariate linear regression - 
Whats a hypothesis function, Cost function?
Gradient descent - algorithm to minimize an arbitrary function.

Thoughts:
Was expecting a reply from Siraj on a tweet. Did not get, but thats fine. Reviewed ML in 3 months. Its pretty aggressive. Will start looking into Math videos by MIT, 3Blue1Brown and Khan academy. Thinking of listening to podcast mlguide.
