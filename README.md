# 100DaysOfMLCode

## Day 1

Progress: 
Enrolled in course by Andrew Ng. Started Week 1. Installed jupyter. 
Introduction about broad variety of algorithms(Supervised/Unsupervised)
Regression, Classification. 

Thoughts:
Have been thinking about doing this challenge for a long time. Hope I can complete this challenge. Objectives by the end of challenge: NLP, Computer vision


## Day 2

Progress:
Continued on course by Andre Ng. 
Basics of unsupervised learning.
Understanding of different algorithms, 
Clustering, Non-clustering(Cocktail party algorithm)
Supervised Learning - Regression:
Univariate linear regression - 
Whats a hypothesis function, Cost function?
Gradient descent - algorithm to minimize an arbitrary function.

Thoughts:
Reviewed ML in 3 months. Its pretty aggressive. Will start looking into Math videos by MIT, 3Blue1Brown and Khan academy. Thinking of listening to podcast mlguide.


## Day 3

Progress:
Gradient descent, Learning rate 
Local minimum, Global minimum
Linear Algebra Review
Started Google ML crash course

Thoughts:
This is interesting, some of the mathematical concepts takes more time. 
I should do this task as a first thing in the morning. have to better manage my time with work, family and other responsibilities.


## Day 4

Progress:
Linear Algebra review
Multivariable Linear regression
Features, Feature Scaling, Mean Normaliation
Octave

Thoughts:
Soon to pick a dataset and start a project. Explore more on Kaggle. No need to tag in twitter. Will log everyday work here.

## Day 5

Progress:
Debugging Gradient Descent
Polynomial regression
quadratic, cubic function, square root
Normal Equation
0 = (Xt X)-1 Xt y
Matrix Invertibility
More on Octave

Thoughts:
Need to learn more about polynomial regression, quadratic, cubic, etc., 


## Day 6

Progress:
Quiz, Octave commands
Histogram plots,

Thoughts:
It has been really slow today. :(
