# 100DaysOfMLCode

## Day 1

Progress: 
Enrolled in course by Andrew Ng. Started Week 1. Installed jupyter. 
Introduction about broad variety of algorithms(Supervised/Unsupervised)
Regression, Classification. 

Thoughts:
Have been thinking about doing this challenge for a long time. Hope I can complete this challenge. Objectives by the end of challenge: NLP, Computer vision


## Day 2

Progress:
Continued on course by Andre Ng. 
Basics of unsupervised learning.
Understanding of different algorithms, 
Clustering, Non-clustering(Cocktail party algorithm)
Supervised Learning - Regression:
Univariate linear regression - 
Whats a hypothesis function, Cost function?
Gradient descent - algorithm to minimize an arbitrary function.

Thoughts:
Reviewed ML in 3 months. Its pretty aggressive. Will start looking into Math videos by MIT, 3Blue1Brown and Khan academy. Thinking of listening to podcast mlguide.


## Day 3

Progress:
Gradient descent, Learning rate 
Local minimum, Global minimum
Linear Algebra Review
Started Google ML crash course

Thoughts:
This is interesting, some of the mathematical concepts takes more time. 
I should do this task as a first thing in the morning. have to better manage my time with work, family and other responsibilities.


## Day 4

Progress:
Linear Algebra review
Multivariable Linear regression
Features, Feature Scaling, Mean Normaliation
Octave

Thoughts:
Soon to pick a dataset and start a project. Explore more on Kaggle. No need to tag in twitter. Will log everyday work here.

## Day 5

Progress:
Debugging Gradient Descent
Polynomial regression
quadratic, cubic function, square root
Normal Equation
0 = (Xt X)-1 Xt y
Matrix Invertibility
More on Octave

Thoughts:
Need to learn more about polynomial regression, quadratic, cubic, etc., 


## Day 6

Progress:
Quiz, Octave commands
Histogram plots,

Thoughts:
It has been really slow today. :(

## Day 7

Progress:
Octave, second quiz,
Plots, subplots, vectorization
Linear Algebra by Gilbert Strang - Row, column, matrix method.
Started Introduction to Statistics course - Udacity

Thoughts:
Updating octave takes forever.

## Day 8

Progress:
Coursera Week 2 Programming Assignment
Matlab

Thoughts:
Practical learning - slow progress thats ok

## Day 9 

Progress:
Coursera Week 2 assignment submission

Thoughts:
Good exercise.


## Day 10

Progress:
On Week3 of Andrew Ng course in coursera. 
Classification - Logistic Regression. 
Decision boundary
Non-linear decision boundaries
Going thru Introduction to Statistics by Sebastian Thrun.

Thoughts:
Start the calculus series soon.
Make a plan of action for rest of the days.

## Day 11

Progress:
Logistic regression
cost function

Thoughts:
Couldn't follow the course, need to find a different source or put more time to understand Logistic regression's formula and representation.


## Day 12

Progress:
Logistic regression
Logistic regression Cost function
if h(x) = 0, when y =1, cost function is infinite
h(x) = 1, when y = 0, cost function is infinite
Gradient descent formula is still the same for logistic regression except h(x)
Advance optimization - Conjugate gradient, BFGS, L-BFGS


Thoughts:
Clear understanding, Yesterday I was probably heavily distracted.
Machine Learning using Java - Safaribooks looks intersting
Saw a link about python in 1 month inluding keras, numpy

## Day 13

Progress:
Logistic Regression
Multi class classification
one-vs-all/one-vs-rest
Overfitting, underfitting
How to address overfitting - reduce number of features, regularization
Regularization 

Thoughts:
Need to start some python course on the side.


## Day 14

Progress:
Coursera week3 assignment

Thoughts:
Slow day, may need to quickly revisit certain concepts again.


## Day 15

Progress:
Week 3 assignment

Thoughts:
Need to finish this soon and start implementing them in python

## Day 16
Progress:
Completed all assignments

Thoughts:
understood more matrix concepts
it has been real slow for past 3 days
should speed up.

## Day 17
Progress:
Week 4 course - AndrewNg
Neural networks - one learning algorithm, neural re-wiring
hidden layer, forward propogation
course:
need to learn quadratic functions


## Day 18
Progress
complted week4 course - Andre Ng
neural network architectures
vectorization
exercises - Matlab Week 4


## Day 19

Progress:
Week 4 exercises
Regularized logistic regression
one vs all classifier

## Day 20

Progress:
Week 4 exercise
One vs all classifier
one vs all prediction

Thoughts:
Real slow for past few days
